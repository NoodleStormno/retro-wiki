![Wii](images/wii.webp)

> Your Wii gets unusually hot after running for a while, fan noise increases, or it even shuts down automatically for protection? Or maybe you can't hear the fan at all and the console is burning hot! Wii's cooling design is more advanced than GameCube's, but dried thermal paste, aging fans, and dust clogging are still common issues. Don't worry—cooling maintenance is relatively simple with high success rates.

## Required Tools
- Phillips screwdriver, PH0 size
- Tri-wing screwdriver (Y-tip), Wii-specific
- Precision tweezers
- High-quality thermal paste (Shin-Etsu 7921 or similar)
- Compressed air can or air blower
- Soft brush
- Isopropyl alcohol and lint-free cloth
- Multimeter (for fan testing)
- Lubricating oil (for fan bearings)
- Anti-static gloves

## Repair Steps

### 1. Disassembly Preparation, Locate Cooling System
1. Unplug all cables, note sensor bar position
2. Remove all bottom screws (note hidden screws under rubber feet)
3. Open case, be careful with WiFi and Bluetooth antennas
4. Locate cooling system—metal heatsink and fan at center of motherboard
5. Note: Need to remove optical drive and some shielding first

### 2. Cooling System Component Inspection
#### Heatsink Inspection:
1. **Dust accumulation**: Check if heatsink fins clogged with dust
2. **Oxidation**: Check if copper heatsink severely oxidized
3. **Heat pipe check**: Check heat pipes for deformation, leakage
4. **Mounting status**: Check if heatsink loose, screws tight

#### Fan Inspection:
1. **Rotation test**: Manually spin fan blades, check smoothness
2. **Noise check**: Listen for abnormal sounds, friction during rotation
3. **Bearing check**: Check bearings for wear, lack of lubrication
4. **Cable check**: Check fan power cable integrity, connector oxidation

#### Thermal Paste Status Check:
1. **Drying/cracking**: Check if original thermal paste dried into powder
2. **Coverage**: Check if still effectively covering chip surface
3. **Contamination**: Check if mixed with dust, impurities
4. **Thickness check**: Check if paste layer too thick or thin

### 3. Deep Cleaning Process
#### Heatsink Cleaning:
1. Gently brush surface dust with soft brush
2. Use compressed air to blow through heatsink fins from inside out
3. Clean stubborn stains with isopropyl alcohol cotton swabs
4. Check each fin for clear passage, no blockage
5. Clean heat pipe to heatsink connection points

#### Fan Cleaning:
1. Clean both sides of fan blades with brush
2. Clean inside fan frame with cotton swabs
3. Check and clean fan power connector
4. Add one drop precision instrument oil to fan bearings (optional)
5. Check fan mounting screws for looseness

#### Motherboard Cleaning:
1. Blow dust off motherboard with compressed air
2. Focus on areas around chips and power section
3. Check other cooling-related components
4. Clean cooling air channels, ensure clear passage

### 4. Thermal Paste Replacement Guide
Most critical step, directly affects cooling performance:

1. **Remove heatsink**:
   - Remove screws securing heatsink (usually 4-6)
   - Gently twist heatsink left-right, don't pull hard
   - Carefully lift heatsink, avoid damaging chip or heat pipes
   - Note heat pipe connections, don't bend excessively

2. **Clean old thermal paste**:
   - Clean GPU chip surface with lint-free cloth and isopropyl alcohol
   - Similarly clean heatsink bottom contact surface
   - Ensure completely clean, no paste residue
   - Check chip surface for scratches, damage

3. **Apply new thermal paste**:
   - Apply pea-sized paste in center of chip
   - Spread evenly with spreader or finger cot
   - Thickness about 0.3-0.5mm, covering entire chip
   - Don't apply too thick, affects thermal conductivity
   - Ensure heatsink can evenly flatten paste

4. **Install heatsink**:
   - Align position, gently lower heatsink
   - Tighten screws in diagonal pattern
   - Moderate force, not too tight or loose
   - Ensure heatsink fully contacts chip

### 5. Fan Repair & Replacement
#### Fan Testing:
1. Measure fan resistance with multimeter, normal about 50-100Ω
2. Test rotation by directly connecting fan to 5V power
3. Measure current, normal about 0.1-0.15A
4. Test speed changes at different voltages

#### Fan Repair:
1. **Bearing lubrication**: Add one drop precision instrument oil
2. **Blade cleaning**: Thoroughly clean each blade
3. **Cable repair**: Solder repair if broken
4. **Frame adjustment**: Carefully adjust if deformed

#### Fan Replacement:
If fan severely damaged:
1. Purchase same specification fan (5V 0.15A 40mm)
2. Note connector orientation and pin definitions
3. Secure fan, ensure alignment with heatsink
4. Test fan rotation direction and airflow

### 6. Cooling System Testing
1. **Idle test**: Power on, observe if fan spins
2. **Temperature test**: Run 30 minutes, feel heatsink temperature
3. **Load test**: Run Super Mario Galaxy for 1 hour
4. **Noise test**: Listen to fan sound at different loads
5. **Auto-shutdown test**: Continuous operation 3-4 hours
6. **Thermal control test**: Observe if fan speed changes with temperature

### 7. Airflow Optimization
Wii airflow optimization suggestions:
1. **Intake cleaning**: Clean bottom intake vents
2. **Exhaust cleaning**: Clean rear exhaust vents
3. **Internal airflow**: Ensure no internal obstructions
4. **External environment**: Ensure good ventilation around console
