   - Observe installation position and direction

2. **Spring replacement**:
   - Purchase appropriate specification replacement spring
   - Note spring tension and length
   - Test feel after replacement

#### Trigger Structure Repair
1. **Structure inspection**:
   - Check trigger mechanical structure integrity
   - Test sliding smoothness
   - Look for wear or damage points

2. **Structure repair**:
   - Minor wear can be sanded for repair
   - Severe damage requires part replacement
   - Improve lubrication to reduce friction

#### Microswitch Repair
1. **Switch access**:
   - Z button microswitch typically harder to access
   - May need to remove more components
   - Operate carefully to avoid damage

2. **Switch handling**:
   - Testing and cleaning methods similar to C button
   - Note space limitations during replacement
   - Test function after installation

### C. Circuit Board Repair

#### Solder Joint Inspection
1. **Visual inspection**:
   - Check button-related solder joints
   - Look for cold solder, poor joints, or cracks
