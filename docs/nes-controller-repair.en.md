From a 20-year veteran technician in Akihabara

> Your NES controller buttons aren't working, the D-pad has dead directions, the A/B buttons don't spring back. Mario falls into pits uncontrollably in *Super Mario Bros.*, you can't fire in *Contra*. Most frustrating is when playing two-player games, only one controller works and your friend just watches.

## Required Tools

This is the standard setup in Akihabara repair shops:

- **Precision screwdriver set**: Japanese-made YATO YT-6991, needs Phillips screwdriver (PH0 size)
- **Plastic spudgers**: For opening controller shells
- **Tweezers**: For removing internal components
- **Isopropyl alcohol**: 99% purity for cleaning contacts
- **Cotton swabs**: For cleaning small areas
- **New conductive rubber pads**: For D-pad and A/B buttons
- **New microswitches**: For Select and Start buttons
- **Multimeter**: For testing continuity
- **Magnifying lamp**: For seeing contact details
- **Anti-static gloves**: For protecting circuit boards
- **Solder and soldering iron**: For replacing microswitches (if needed)
- **Controller test software**: For testing all button functions
- **Cable repair kit**: For fixing damaged cables (optional)

## Detailed Repair Steps

I've been repairing Nintendo controllers in Akihabara for 20 years. Follow this method, take your time.

### Step 1: Controller Diagnosis

First identify the problem type:

1. **Visual inspection**:
   - Check cable for damage
   - Check shell for cracks
   - Check connector for oxidation

2. **Function testing**:
   - Connect to NES and test all buttons
   - Test all four D-pad directions
   - Test A/B buttons
   - Test Select and Start buttons

3. **Problem type identification**:
   - **Single button failure**: Rubber pad or contact issue
   - **Multiple button failures**: Cable or circuit board issue
   - **Complete non-response**: Cable break or connector issue
   - **Intermittent failure**: Poor contact

### Step 2: Controller Disassembly

Carefully open the controller:

1. **Remove shell screws**:
   - NES controller uses 3 Phillips screws
   - Screws are on the back, covered by rubber pads
   - Use PH0 size screwdriver

2. **Open the shell**:
   - Gently pry open with plastic spudger
   - Note internal ribbon cable connections
   - Don't use force, you'll break the clips

3. **Remove internal components**:
   - Gently remove circuit board
   - Remove conductive rubber pads
   - Place on anti-static mat

### Step 3: Conductive Rubber Replacement

Conductive rubber aging is the most common issue:

1. **Rubber pad inspection**:
   - D-pad: Cross-shaped rubber pad
   - A/B buttons: Two circular rubber pads
   - Check if rubber has hardened or cracked
   - Check if conductive layer is worn

2. **Contact cleaning**:
   - Clean circuit board contacts with isopropyl alcohol on cotton swab
   - Clean every contact thoroughly
   - Check for oxidation

3. **Install new rubber pads**:
   - Align D-pad rubber with cross shaft
   - Align A/B button rubber with positions
   - Ensure rubber pads fit perfectly

### Step 4: Microswitch Repair

Select and Start buttons use microswitches:

1. **Switch inspection**:
   - Should make crisp click when pressed
   - Test continuity with multimeter
   - Check solder joints for cracks

2. **Switch cleaning**:
   - Spray small amount of electronic cleaner
   - Press repeatedly several times
   - Let cleaner evaporate completely

3. **Switch replacement**:
   - Replace if switch is damaged
   - Remove old switch with soldering iron
   - Solder new switch (note orientation)

### Step 5: Circuit Board Repair

If rubber and switches are fine:

1. **Circuit board inspection**:
   - Check board for cracks
   - Check traces for breaks
   - Check components for damage

2. **Cable inspection**:
   - NES controller cable has 7 wires
   - Test continuity of each wire
   - Check connector for oxidation

3. **Wire jump repair**:
   - If broken trace found
   - Connect break point with enameled wire
   - Insulate with UV-cure adhesive

### Step 6: Cable Repair

Cable damage is common:

1. **Cable type**:
   - NES controller uses 7-wire cable
   - Wire order: Ground, Clock, Latch, Data, +5V, others
   - Don't mix up wire order

2. **Cable replacement**:
   - Remove old cable
   - Solder new cable (note wire order)
   - Test all functions

3. **Connector repair**:
   - Clean connector gold fingers
   - Check pins for bending
   - Replace entire connector if necessary

### Step 7: Shell Repair

Shell damage also needs attention:

1. **Shell cleaning**:
   - Clean shell with isopropyl alcohol
   - Remove stains and oxidation
   - Restore original color

2. **Crack repair**:
   - Small cracks can be fixed with plastic adhesive
   - Large cracks may need shell replacement
   - Maintain original appearance

3. **Button repair**:
   - Check D-pad cross shaft for wear
   - Check A/B button caps for looseness
   - Replace buttons if necessary

### Step 8: Assembly and Testing

1. **Preliminary assembly**:
   - Install circuit board and rubber pads
   - Align all positions
   - Gently close shell

2. **Function testing**:
   - Connect to NES and test all buttons
   - Test response speed
   - Test prolonged pressing

3. **Final assembly**:
   - Install screws after testing passes
   - Clean exterior
   - Apply original stickers (if available)

## Veteran Technician's Advice

After 20 years in Akihabara, customers often ask these questions. I'll answer them one by one.

### Why do NES controllers fail easily?

Three main reasons. First is usage frequency - action games wear controllers heavily. Second is design - conductive rubber has limited lifespan. Third is storage environment - humidity causes oxidation.

### What's the difference between original and aftermarket controllers?

**Original controllers**:
- Good feel, appropriate button pressure
- Stable quality, long lifespan
- Durable cable
- But expensive, may be hard to find

**Aftermarket controllers**:
- Cheap price
- Easy to buy
- But feel may be inferior
- Quality varies
- May not be compatible with all games

### Can I mod for wireless controllers?

Yes, but not recommended. Wireless mods may introduce lag, affecting gameplay. May not be compatible with all NES models. If you must mod, use proven solutions.

### How to maintain controllers?

I recommend regular cleaning, once a month. Avoid excessive force during use. Store with cable coiled, avoid kinks. Don't pull on cable. Avoid hot, humid environments.

## Repair Difficulty

**Technical difficulty**: ★★★☆☆ (requires careful operation)  
**Tool requirements**: ★★★☆☆ (needs basic tools)  
**Time cost**: About 1-2 hours  
**Success rate**: High, over 90%

## My Ultimate Advice

After 20 years in Akihabara, I've learned these lessons:

1. Clean first, replace later - many issues can be fixed by cleaning
2. Rubber pads are key - replace when aged
3. Check cables - broken wires are common
4. Test thoroughly - test all buttons
5. Prevention matters - proper use extends lifespan

Final thoughts. The NES controller is the hands of gaming. Without a responsive controller, even the best games aren't enjoyable. Many customers bring controllers for repair to continue playing classic games. Maybe it's a childhood companion, maybe a tournament weapon.

Remember, you're not just fixing a controller - you're restoring game control. Take your time, you can do it.
