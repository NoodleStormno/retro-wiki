- **Time**: 30-60 seconds per area
- **Distance**: 10-15cm, keep moving
- **Test**: Periodically test adhesive softening

#### Separation Techniques
1. Start from corner, use suction cup to create gap
2. Insert thin plastic sheet, slowly move
3. Use isopropyl alcohol for stubborn adhesive
4. Keep screen flat, avoid bending

### Step 4: Digitizer Separation (If Needed)
1. Screen and digitizer may be bonded
2. Requires more precise separation
3. Higher risk, both components easily damaged
4. Consider replacing entire screen assembly

### Step 5: Cleaning & Preparation

2. Clean with isopropyl alcohol, ensure completely dry
3. Prepare new adhesive tape (if needed)
4. Check all components intact

## Video Tutorial Key Points

### Common Mistakes (Video Emphasized)
1. **Insufficient heating**: Adhesive not softened, forced separation damages screen
2. **Overheating**: Damages screen or internal components
3. **Wrong tools**: Metal tools scratch screen
4. **Wrong angle**: Incorrect separation angle causes cracking
5. **Rushing**: No patience, too fast operation

### Success Techniques (Video Demonstrated)
1. **Even heating**: Keep heat gun moving, even heating
2. **Test softening**: Periodically test adhesive with plastic tool
3. **Sectional operation**: Small areas, step-by-step separation
4. **Professional tools**: Screen suction cups and separation tools
5. **Keep screen flat**: Avoid any bending pressure

## Reinstallation Key Points

### New Screen Installation
1. **Test first**: Test new screen function before installation
2. **Precise alignment**: Ensure screen perfectly aligned with frame
3. **Even pressure**: Apply pressure evenly from center outward
4. **Check bubbles**: Ensure no air bubbles, reinstall if present

### Adhesive Selection
1. **Specialized tape**: Electronics-specific double-sided tape, appropriate thickness
2. **B-7000 adhesive**: Flexible, allows repositioning
3. **Avoid strong adhesives**: Difficult to repair, may damage screen
4. **Even application**: Ensure adhesive evenly distributed

## Risks & Alternative Solutions

### High-Risk Situations
1. **First attempt**: No experience, high failure rate
2. **Old devices**: Aged adhesive, harder separation
3. **OLED screens**: PS Vita 1000 OLED more fragile
4. **Integrated digitizer**: Separation difficulty doubled

### Alternative Considerations
1. **Professional repair**: Leave to professional repair shop
2. **Complete unit replacement**: If device value low
3. **Outer screen only**: If inner screen intact, replace only outer screen/digitizer
4. **Use protection**: If damage minor, use screen protector

## Cost-Benefit Analysis

### Repair Costs
- **OEM screen assembly**: ¥400-800 (OLED more expensive)
- **Professional repair service**: ¥300-600 (including labor)
- **DIY risk**: May damage screen, increasing cost
- **Time cost**: 3-5 hours (first attempt)

### Decision Advice
1. **Device value**: Current market value of device
