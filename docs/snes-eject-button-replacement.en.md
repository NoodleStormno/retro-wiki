![Super Nintendo Limited Edition](images/supernintendo2.webp)

## Overview

The Super Nintendo (SNES) eject button, located on the front of the console, allows easy removal of game cartridges. Due to prolonged use, this button can develop issues like wear, sticking, or complete failure. This guide provides detailed instructions for diagnosing and replacing the SNES eject button.

## Required Tools

- Phillips screwdrivers (#00 and #1)
- Flathead screwdriver or plastic spudger
- Tweezers
- New SNES eject button (ensure compatibility)
- Isopropyl alcohol and cotton swabs
- Silicone-based lubricant (optional)
- Anti-static wrist strap (recommended)

## Safety Precautions

1. **Power off**: Ensure SNES is completely unplugged from all cables
2. **Static protection**: Wear anti-static wrist strap when handling internal components
3. **Careful with plastic**: SNES case plastic may be brittle—avoid excessive force during disassembly
4. **Parts storage**: Keep all screws and parts in safe location during disassembly
5. **Photo documentation**: Take photos before disassembly to record original assembly

## Diagnostic Steps

Before deciding to replace the button, confirm the problem nature:

### Step 1: Problem Analysis
1. **Test button function**:
   - Press button, observe if cartridge ejection mechanism works smoothly
   - Note button feel: sticking, loose, or completely unresponsive

2. **Common symptoms**:
   - **Button stuck**: Won't return after pressing
   - **Button loose**: Rattles when shaking console
   - **Function failure**: Pressing doesn't eject cartridge
   - **Abnormal feel**: Requires unusually strong force to press

### Step 2: External Inspection
1. **Visual check**:
   - Look for cracks, wear on button
   - Check for foreign objects stuck around button
   - Observe if button position is skewed

2. **Cleaning test**:
   - Clean around button with isopropyl alcohol and cotton swab
   - Use compressed air to blow out possible dust
   - Test if button function improves

### Step 3: Internal Inspection (If Needed)
If external cleaning doesn't help, may need to open console:
1. Check if button spring damaged or missing
2. Check for wear on button mechanism
3. Check cartridge ejection mechanism function

## Replacement Steps

### Step 1: Disassemble Console Case

1. **Preparation**:
   - Unplug all cables (power, video, controllers)
   - Place console on soft, anti-static work surface
   - Prepare container for screws

2. **Remove bottom screws**:
   - Use #1 Phillips screwdriver to remove all bottom screws
   - SNES typically has 6-7 bottom screws
   - Note screw lengths may differ, record positions

3. **Separate case**:
   - Carefully lift top case
   - Note top case may have clip connections
   - If internal cables (power switch, reset button), disconnect them first

### Step 2: Access Eject Button

1. **Locate button assembly**:
   - Eject button located on front right of console
   - Button typically integrated with case or separate component

2. **Identify button type**:
   - **Early models**: Button may be part of case
   - **Later models**: Button may be separate component
   - Observe how button is secured

### Step 3: Remove Old Button

#### Case A: Button Part of Case
If button integrated with top case:

1. **Check damage extent**:
   - If only minor wear, may not need entire case replacement
   - If button broken, need to replace entire top case

2. **Replace top case**:
   - Purchase compatible SNES top case replacement
   - Transfer all internal components to new case
   - Pay attention to button mechanism alignment

#### Case B: Button Separate Component
If button can be replaced separately:

1. **Release securing**:
   - Observe how button secured (clips, screws, or adhesive)
   - Use plastic spudger to carefully release clips
   - If screws used, remove securing screws

2. **Remove old button**:
   - Gently wiggle button to loosen
   - Note there may be spring or other small parts
   - Remove all related parts with tweezers

3. **Clean installation area**:
   - Clean button mounting area with isopropyl alcohol
   - Remove any old adhesive residue
   - Check mounting area integrity

### Step 4: Install New Button

1. **Prepare new button**:
   - Check if new button same dimensions as old
   - Test button action smoothness
   - Clean new button if needed

2. **Install spring (if present)**:
   - If button uses spring, install spring first
   - Ensure correct spring orientation
   - Test spring tension

3. **Install button**:
   - Align button with mounting position
   - Gently press until clicks into place
   - If screws used, tighten securing screws (don't overtighten)

4. **Lubrication (optional)**:
   - If button action not smooth enough, use small amount silicone lubricant
   - Apply only to friction points
   - Avoid contaminating other components

### Step 5: Test Button Function

1. **Manual testing**:
   - Press button multiple times, test action smoothness
   - Check if button fully returns
   - Test button travel and feel

2. **Linkage with ejection mechanism test**:
   - Temporarily install cartridge tray or simulate cartridge
   - Test if cartridge ejection mechanism works when button pressed
   - Check overall system coordination

### Step 6: Reassemble Console

1. **Reconnect internal cables**:
   - Reconnect all internal cables previously disconnected
   - Ensure secure connections

2. **Close case**:
   - Align top and bottom cases
   - Ensure all clips properly engage
   - Avoid pinching cables

3. **Tighten screws**:
   - Install all screws in original positions
   - Tighten evenly in diagonal pattern
   - Don't overtighten to avoid damaging plastic threads

### Step 7: Final Testing

1. **Function testing**:
   - Connect power and video cables
   - Insert game cartridge
   - Test eject button function:
     a. Press button, cartridge should eject smoothly
     b. Button should automatically return to position
     c. Repeat test multiple times for stability

2. **Comprehensive check**:
   - Check all console functions normal
   - Test power switch, reset button
   - Test controller ports

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: New Button Sticking
- **Possible cause**: Size mismatch or improper installation
- **Solution**: Check button dimensions, reinstall, lightly sand if necessary

### Issue 2: Button Won't Return
- **Possible cause**: Spring missing, damaged, or incorrectly installed
- **Solution**: Check spring, ensure proper installation

### Issue 3: Button Presses But Cartridge Won't Eject
- **Possible cause**: Connection issue between button and ejection mechanism
- **Solution**: Check linkage mechanism, ensure proper connection

### Issue 4: Button Loose
- **Possible cause**: Poor securing or component wear
- **Solution**: Strengthen securing, or replace worn components

## Preventive Maintenance

1. **Proper use**:
   - Use appropriate force when pressing button
   - Don't use sharp objects to press button
   - Avoid forcing stop during cartridge ejection

2. **Regular cleaning**:
   - Clean around button every 3-6 months
   - Use compressed air to remove dust
   - Check button action smoothness

3. **Environment control**:
   - Avoid high temperature, high humidity environments
   - Prevent dust accumulation
   - Regularly check plastic components for aging

## Technical Specifications

- **Button type**: Mechanical press button
- **Material**: ABS plastic (typically)
- **Color**: Gray (matches console case)
- **Travel**: Approximately 2-3mm
- **Operating force**: Approximately 50-100 grams force

## Professional Tips

1. **Plastic handling**:
   - Aged SNES plastic may be brittle—handle with extra care
   - Use plastic-specific tools, avoid metal tools that can scratch
   - If plastic clips break, use plastic welding or specialized adhesive for repair

2. **Spring selection**:
   - If spring missing, need to find suitable replacement
   - Test spring tension to ensure button returns properly
   - Record spring specifications for future replacement

3. **Compatibility check**:
   - SNES has different models (SNS-001, SNS-101, etc.)
   - Ensure button compatible with your model
   - Confirm part number or provide console photo before purchase

## Alternative Solutions

If original button unavailable:

1. **3D printing**: Print replacement button if you have 3D printer
2. **Donor console**: Harvest button from damaged SNES console
3. **Custom fabrication**: Hand-make button using suitable materials
4. **Professional repair**: Seek professional game console repair service

## Summary

Replacing SNES eject button is a relatively simple repair task, with main challenges being careful handling of plastic components and ensuring proper assembly.
