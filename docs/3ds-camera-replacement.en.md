*As taught by a 20-year veteran technician from Akihabara*

> Your Nintendo 3DS camera is malfunctioning, resulting in a completely black screen when taking pictures, or producing blurry, spotted images. It fails to recognize cards in *AR Games*, and 3D photos only display in 2D. In the worst-case scenario, both the inner and outer cameras are defective, rendering the autostereoscopic (glasses-free 3D) functionality completely inoperative.

## Required Tools & Equipment

This is the standard kit used in Akihabara repair shops:

-   **Precision Screwdriver Set**: Japanese-made YATO YT-6991. A Phillips #00 (PH00) screwdriver is essential.
-   **Plastic Spudger/Pry Tool Set**: Assorted sizes for prying and separating components.
-   **Tweezers**: One pair with angled tips and one pair with straight tips.
-   **Isopropyl Alcohol (IPA)**: 99% purity for cleaning camera lenses and connector contacts.
-   **Cotton Swabs**: For precise cleaning in tight spaces.
-   **Replacement Camera Module**: OEM or compatible part.
-   **Hot Air Rework Station**: For desoldering the old camera module (precise temperature control is critical).
-   **Multimeter**: For verifying power supply to the camera circuit.
-   **Magnifying Lamp/Illuminated Magnifier**: Essential for inspecting tiny solder joints and connectors.
-   **Anti-Static Wrist Strap**: To protect the CMOS image sensors on the mainboard from ESD damage.
-   **Solder & Soldering Iron**: Required if dealing with BGA (Ball Grid Array) packages or reflowing connections.
-   **Camera Diagnostic/Test Software**: For verifying camera functionality post-repair.
