# PSP 1000 Analog Stick Repair Complete Guide

> Your PSP 1000 analog stick is drifting - characters move on their own, aiming reticle floats randomly, or certain directions don't respond. Don't worry, this is a common PSP 1000 analog stick module failure. As the only analog stick in the PSP series, its repair is relatively simple with high success rate!

## Required Tools
- Phillips screwdriver, PH00 size
- Plastic spudger or guitar pick
- New PSP 1000 analog stick module
- Anhydrous alcohol and cotton swabs
- Precision tweezers
- Anti-static gloves and work mat
- Soldering iron and solder (if soldering needed)

## Repair Steps

### 1. Safe Disassembly
1. **Remove battery and UMD**: Ensure PSP completely powered off
2. **Remove back screws**: 6 Phillips screws on back
   - 4 inside battery compartment (need to remove battery)
   - 2 inside UMD compartment (need to open UMD door)
3. **Separate shell**: Gently pry open edges with plastic spudger
4. **Note ribbon cables**: Be careful with screen and button ribbon cables when opening

### 2. Analog Stick Module Location
1. **Find analog stick module**: Located top left of motherboard
2. **Identify module type**: PSP 1000 uses independent analog stick module
3. **Disconnect**:
   - If plug-in type: Simply unplug ribbon cable
   - If soldered type: Need to desolder 4 solder points

### 3. Analog Stick Module Replacement
#### Case 1: Plug-in Module (Most PSP 1000)
1. **Unplug ribbon cable**: Gently lift ribbon cable latch with tweezers, unplug cable
2. **Remove securing screws**: Usually 1-2 small screws securing module
3. **Remove old module**: Gently remove entire analog stick module
4. **Install new module**: Align position, install securing screws
5. **Connect ribbon cable**: Insert ribbon cable, press latch to secure

#### Case 2: Soldered Module (Early batches)
1. **Mark solder points**: Mark 4 solder point positions with marker
2. **Heat solder points**: Heat each solder point with soldering iron
3. **Remove solder**: Clean solder points with desoldering pump or wick
4. **Remove module**: Remove module after solder points cleaned
5. **Solder new module**: Align position, solder each point
6. **Check soldering**: Ensure solder points full, no shorts

### 4. Analog Stick Calibration
1. **Assembly test**: Test with battery before reassembling shell
2. **Enter service mode**: Hold SELECT + START + △ + ○ while powered off, then press power
3. **Analog stick test**: Select "Analog Stick Test" in test menu
4. **Check values**: X/Y axis should show 128/128 when centered
5. **Calibration**: If values deviate significantly, perform calibration in settings

### 5. Common Fault Repairs
#### Fault 1: Stick drift (automatic movement)
1. **Clean potentiometer**: Disassemble stick module, clean carbon film with anhydrous alcohol
2. **Replace potentiometer**: If cleaning ineffective, replace entire potentiometer
3. **Check ribbon cable**: Poor ribbon cable contact can also cause drift

#### Fault 2: No response in certain direction
1. **Check carbon film wear**: Corresponding direction carbon film may be worn
2. **Check spring contact**: Spring contact poor or deformed
3. **Replace module**: Most reliable to replace entire analog stick module

#### Fault 3: Loose stick
1. **Check securing structure**: Securing structure under stick cap may be worn
2. **Replace stick cap**: Replace entire stick cap assembly
3. **Add shims**: Add thin shims at stick base to increase tightness

### 🛠️ Deep Cleaning and Maintenance
If don't want to replace, try deep cleaning:

#### Step 1: Disassemble analog stick module
1. Remove stick cap (usually can be pulled off)
2. Open module shell (careful with clips)
3. Expose internal potentiometers

#### Step 2: Clean carbon film
1. Use anhydrous alcohol and cotton swabs
2. Gently wipe carbon film surface
3. Don't damage carbon film coating
4. Clean spring contact points

#### Step 3: Lubrication and assembly
1. Add small amount of silicone grease to moving parts
2. Reassemble module
3. Test function

### 🔍 Root Causes of Stick Drift
1. **Carbon film wear**: Long-term use thins carbon film
2. **Dust ingress**: Dust affects potentiometer contact
3. **Oxidation issues**: Metal contact oxidation causes poor contact
4. **Mechanical wear**: Plastic part wear increases clearance

### 🎯 Analog Stick Usage Tips
1. **Avoid forceful operation**: Gentle use extends lifespan
2. **Regular cleaning**: Clean around stick every 6 months
3. **Use stick caps**: Improve feel, reduce direct wear
4. **Gaming habits**: Action games cause significant stick wear

### 📊 Stick Wear by Game Type
1. **Racing games**: Medium wear, mainly left/right directions
2. **Shooting games**: High wear, frequent fine aiming adjustments
3. **Action games**: High wear, frequent omnidirectional operation
4. **RPG games**: Low wear, mainly movement directions

### 🔧 Advanced Mod: Hall Effect Stick
If you want ultimate analog stick experience:

#### Hall stick advantages
1. **No contact wear**: Magnetic sensing, no physical contact
2. **Never drifts**: Fundamentally solves drift issues
3. **Higher precision**: Theoretical infinite resolution
4. **Extreme lifespan**: Almost never fails

#### Modification difficulty
1. **Requires soldering**: Must solder 4 wires
2. **May need programming**: May require firmware modification
3. **Higher cost**: Hall modules more expensive
4. **For experts**: Not recommended for beginners

**Player experience**: PSP 1000 analog stick design actually quite durable, most issues solvable by module replacement. Original ALPS modules best quality, if can find original used parts, prioritize those.

**Repair insights**: Most important when disassembling PSP 1000 is screen ribbon cable, very fragile. Recommend watching disassembly video first. Stick repair itself not difficult, difficult is safely disassembling/reassembling entire device.

**Final advice**: If stick only slightly drifting, try software calibration first. If calibration ineffective, then consider hardware repair. When replacing module, recommend also cleaning stick interface on motherboard for best contact.
