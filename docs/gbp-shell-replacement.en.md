From a 20-year veteran technician in Akihabara

> Your Game Boy Pocket shell is heavily worn, covered in scratches, or even cracked. Could be years of use marks, or damage from accidental drops. Most regrettable are limited edition colors—shell damage significantly reduces value.

## Preparation Tools

Standard Akihabara repair shop configuration:

- **Precision screwdriver set**: Japanese-made YATO YT-6991, needs Y-type screwdriver (Y00 size)
- **Plastic spudger set**: Different size spudgers to avoid scratching shell
- **Tweezers**: Bent and straight types
- **Isopropyl alcohol**: 99% purity, for cleaning shell and interior
- **Cotton swabs**: For cleaning small areas
- **Anti-static cloth**: For wiping screen and interior
- **Heat gun or hair dryer**: For softening double-sided adhesive (optional)
- **New shell set**: Need both front and back shells
- **Screw storage box**: Organize removed screws by type
- **Work mat**: Anti-static mat to protect shell

## Detailed Repair Steps

I've repaired GameBoys in Akihabara for 20 years—this method works. Follow along, don't rush.

### Step 1: Safe Disassembly

Most feared during disassembly: scratching shell or damaging internal components. Go slowly:

1. **Prepare workbench**: Lay anti-static mat, prepare all tools
2. **Remove batteries**: Remove battery cover, take out 2 AAA batteries
3. **Remove screws**:
   - 4 Y-type screws at four corners on back
   - 2 Phillips screws hidden under battery compartment sticker (carefully peel sticker)
4. **Separate shell**:
   - Gently pry open from charging port area with plastic spudger
   - Work slowly around edges, pause when hearing clip release sounds
   - Don't use metal tools—will leave scratches
5. **Disconnect**:
   - Disconnect motherboard to LCD flex cable
   - Gently lift flex cable latch with fingernail or plastic piece

### Step 2: Internal Component Transfer

Most critical step—operate carefully:

1. **Remove motherboard**: Remove 2 screws securing motherboard, carefully remove board
2. **Remove screen assembly**: Includes LCD, reflector, light guide (if present)
3. **Remove button board**: D-pad, A/B buttons, Select/Start buttons
4. **Remove power switch and adjustment wheels**: Volume wheel and contrast wheel
5. **Remove speaker**: Carefully disconnect
6. **Organize storage**: Arrange all components in order, photograph original positions

### Step 3: Cleaning & Inspection

Clean all components before installing into new shell:

1. **Motherboard cleaning**: Clean board with isopropyl alcohol and cotton swabs, especially battery contacts and connectors
2. **Screen cleaning**: Gently wipe LCD with anti-static cloth, don't spray alcohol directly
3. **Button cleaning**: Clean button contacts, check rubber pads for aging
4. **Shell interior**: Check new shell interior for burrs or defects
5. **Screw hole check**: Ensure new shell screw holes correctly positioned

### Step 4: Install into New Shell

Install in reverse order, but more carefully:

1. **Install speaker**: Install speaker first, note orientation
2. **Install power switch and adjustment wheels**:
   - Align volume and contrast wheels with holes
   - Ensure power switch properly installed
3. **Install button board**:
   - Align D-pad cross axis
   - Lay A/B button rubber pads flat
   - Don't lose Select/Start button springs (if present)
4. **Install screen assembly**:
   - Place reflector first, then light guide (if present)
   - Finally LCD, leave sufficient flex cable length
5. **Install motherboard**:
   - Align all screw holes
   - Connect screen flex cable, lock latch
   - Connect speaker wire
6. **Test**: Don't install screws yet, connect batteries to test all functions

### Step 5: Close Shell & Final Testing

After testing passes, officially close shell:

1. **Align shells**: Align front/back shells at all clip positions
2. **Gently press**: Start from one side, listen for clip engagement sounds
3. **Install screws**:
   - Install 4 Y-type screws on back first, don't overtighten
   - Then install 2 Phillips screws in battery compartment
4. **Final testing**:
   - Power on test
   - Test all buttons
   - Test sound
   - Test power switch
   - Run game test
5. **Reapply stickers**: If original stickers still usable, carefully reapply

## Veteran Technician's Advice

Running shop in Akihabara 20 years, customers often ask these questions—I'll answer each:

### Why Do Game Boy Pocket Shells Easily Damage?

Three main reasons. First: material—ABS plastic becomes brittle after 20+ years. Second: usage frequency—handhelds often carried, prone to bumps. Third: storage environment—direct sunlight causes discoloration, humidity causes mold spots.

### Difference Between Original and Third-party Shells?

Big difference. Original shells:
- Better material, more durable
- Accurate colors, especially limited editions
- Precise clip design, tight closure
- Has Nintendo's quality feel

Third-party shells:
- Cheaper price
- More color choices
- But material may be thinner
- Clips may not be precise
- Colors may have variance

### Does Shell Replacement Affect Machine Value?

Depends. If standard edition replaced with original shell, minimal effect. If limited edition replaced with third-party shell, value significantly reduced. If repair replacement (e.g., cracked shell must replace) using original or high-quality third-party shell, minimal effect on value.

### How to Maintain Shell?

I recommend using protective case to reduce direct impacts. Store away from direct sunlight. Regular cleaning with soft cloth. Don't use alcohol or organic solvents—causes plastic whitening.

## Repair Difficulty

Technical difficulty: 3 stars—mainly care and patience. Tool requirements: 2 stars—basic tools sufficient. Time cost: 1-2 hours, longer first attempt. Success rate high: 95%+.

## My Ultimate Advice

20 years in Akihabara, I've summarized these experiences:

1. Photograph documentation—take photo each disassembly step, reference during assembly
2. Organize screws—store screws from different positions separately
3. Gentle operation—plastic clips are fragile
4. Test first—test at halfway point, avoid discovering issues after complete assembly
5. Accept imperfection—20+ year old machine, new shell may have minor flaws

Final heartfelt words: Shell is Game Boy Pocket's face. Many customers bring for shell replacement not for selling, but to recapture that old feeling. That gray Pocket that accompanied childhood, with new shell, feels like 1996 again.

Remember, you're repairing not just a game console, but a piece of youth. Take your time, you can do it.
