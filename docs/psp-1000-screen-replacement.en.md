3. **Clean contacts**: Clean connector with isopropyl alcohol
4. **Secure position**: Ensure proper cable routing during reassembly

### 🔧 Screen Frame & Adhesive Handling
PSP 1000 screens use double-sided adhesive:

#### Old Adhesive Removal

**Repair Experience**: PSP 1000 screen replacement is the easiest among all PSP models due to its relatively simple construction. The biggest challenge is the screen flex cable—handle it carefully. If this is your first disassembly, watch a teardown video first to understand each step.

**Cost-Benefit Analysis**: A good compatible screen costs about $9-14, allowing your PSP 1000 to serve for many more years. Compared to buying a new device, repair is very cost-effective.

**Final Reminder**: If display issues occur after screen replacement, first check flex cable connection. 90% of installation problems are due to improperly seated flex cables. If cable connection is confirmed good, then consider screen quality issues.
