# PS1 Laser Diode Power Adjustment & Disc Reading Repair

> Your old PS1 is getting picky! Some discs read fine, others it flat-out refuses. The disc spins up fast but won't load the game, sometimes showing "Please insert PlayStation format disc."

## Required Tools
- Phillips screwdriver, PH0 size
- Small flathead screwdriver
- 99% isopropyl alcohol and cotton swabs
- Multimeter (optional, for veterans)
- Anti-static wrist strap (protects the board)
- Bright flashlight

## Repair Procedure

### 1. Open It Up, Find the Problem
1. Unplug all cables, flip PS1 over
2. Remove 7 bottom screws (note varying lengths, track positions)
3. Carefully open shell—don't tear ribbon cables
4. Locate laser assembly—the little sled with the lens

### 2. Basic Cleaning, First Approach
1. Use air blower to remove surface dust
2. Dip cotton swab in minimal alcohol, gently wipe lens
3. **Critical**: Wipe in one direction only—no back-and-forth scrubbing
4. Check laser sled rails, apply light lubricant

### 3. Power Adjustment, Targeted Fix
1. Locate potentiometer on laser back (usually labeled "VR")
2. Using flathead, **counter-clockwise** adjust 15-30 degrees
3. Reassemble shell, power on for test
4. If still problematic, adjust another 15 degrees—**never over-adjust**

### 4. Final Testing, Verification
1. Test with your most familiar game disc (I use *Resident Evil 2*)
2. Test different disc regions (inner and outer tracks)
3. Continuous read test for 30 minutes, observe stability
4. Note optimal adjustment position for future fine-tuning

## Parts & Pricing Reference

| Component | Price Range | Source | Veteran Advice |
|-----------|------------|--------|----------------|
| PS1 Laser Assembly | ¥60-90 | Xianyu/Taobao | Buy with sled included—saves hassle |
| KSM-440AAM Laser Pickup | ¥45-65 | Specialty shops | Original salvaged parts best |

| Cleaning Kit | ¥20-30 | Phone repair shops | Get one with lens cloth |

## Veteran Experience

### 💡 Adjustment Insights
- **First attempt**: Clean first—80% of issues resolve with cleaning
- **Adjustment range**: Never exceed 30 degrees per adjustment—over-adjusting burns the diode
- **Testing method**: Test with audio CD first, then game discs
- **Final solution**: If adjustment fails, replace laser—don't waste time

### ⚠️ Pitfalls to Avoid
1. **Don't blow on laser with mouth**: Saliva vapor corrodes lens
2. **Don't use regular alcohol**: Must be 99% isopropyl
3. **Don't adjust while powered**: Risk of shock or board damage
4. **Don't buy knockoff lasers**: Short lifespan, poor reading

### 🎮 Game Compatibility Notes
- **Early PS1 (SCPH-1000)**: Adjustment effective but laser ages quickly
- **Late PS1 (SCPH-7500)**: Laser more durable but adjustment range limited
- **PSone mini**: Lasers hard to find—consider HDD mod instead

## Repair Difficulty: ★★★☆☆  
## Estimated Time: 1-2 hours
## Success Rate: 85% (cleaning + adjustment), 95% (new laser)

**Final Thoughts**: Every old PS1 has its quirks. Be patient—those late nights it gave you are worth this effort. Once fixed, brew some tea, pop in *Final Fantasy VII*, and listen to that familiar laser seeking sound—that's the sound of youth.
