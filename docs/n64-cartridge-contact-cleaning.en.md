![Nintendo 64](images/n64.webp)

> Your N64 is starting to lose its memory! Games work sometimes, sometimes not—frequent glitches, artifacts, crashes, or just shows "No Cartridge." Sometimes you need to pull out the cartridge and blow on it, the old tradition, insert multiple times before it recognizes. Most frustrating: sudden black screen at critical moments, losing all progress!

## Required Tools
- Phillips screwdriver, 3.8mm game console specific
- 99% isopropyl alcohol, better than regular alcohol
- Cotton swabs and microfiber cloth
- Pencil eraser, old-school method
- Electronic contact cleaner, premium option
- Magnifying glass, for examining contacts

## Repair Steps

### 1. Open Cartridge for Inspection
1. Use special screwdriver to remove bottom cartridge screws
2. **Careful**: N64 cartridge shells are brittle, don't use excessive force
3. Open shell, remove PCB board
4. Observe contact oxidation (black/green discoloration indicates oxidation)

### 2. Traditional Method: Eraser Technique
1. Gently rub contacts with pencil eraser
2. **Unidirectional rubbing**, don't scrub back and forth
3. Rub until contacts shine
4. Use air blower to remove eraser debris

### 3. Modern Method: Solvent Cleaning
1. Dip cotton swab in isopropyl alcohol, wipe contacts
2. Also unidirectional wiping
3. Wait for complete evaporation (1-2 minutes)
4. Final polish with microfiber cloth

### 4. Console Cartridge Slot Cleaning
1. Dip cotton swab in isopropyl alcohol, insert into console slot
2. Gently wipe left-right
3. Repeat 2-3 times with clean swabs
4. **Never use metal objects to poke slot**

### 5. Assembly & Testing
1. Reassemble cartridge shell, tighten screws
2. Insert into console, power on test
3. Insert/remove 3-5 times to wear in contacts and slot
4. Run game 1 hour, test stability

### 🎮 Which Games Are Most Picky About Contacts
1. **Zelda: Ocarina of Time** - Frequent saves, crashes with poor contact
2. **GoldenEye 007** - Complex 3D graphics, prone to artifacts
3. **Mario Kart 64** - Highest demands during 4-player matches
4. **Banjo-Kazooie** - This game already prone to bugs

### 🔧 Different Oxidation Levels Treatment
- **Light oxidation** (slightly darkened): Eraser method sufficient
- **Moderate oxidation** (clearly blackened): Isopropyl alcohol deep cleaning
- **Severe oxidation** (green/fuzzy): May need sanding (use cautiously)
- **Corrosion holes**: Give up treatment, buy new cartridge

### 💾 Cartridge Storage Guide
1. **Moisture protection**: Use desiccant, essential for southern players
2. **Dust protection**: Use cartridge cases, don't store naked
3. **Pressure protection**: Don't stack too high, shells can deform
4. **Regular maintenance**: Clean contacts every 6 months

## Repair Difficulty: ★☆☆☆☆
## Estimated Time: 30 minutes each
## Success Probability: 95% (most revive after cleaning)

### 📚 Trivia: Why Blowing Cartridges Works?
Old-school players love "blowing cartridges"—actually has some scientific basis:
1. Blowing removes dust
2. Warm air causes slight metal expansion, improving contact
3. **But**: Saliva moisture accelerates oxidation, so not recommended now

### 🎯 Ultimate Solutions
If still problematic after cleaning, could be:
1. **Internal cartridge issues**: Need to resolder ROM chips
2. **Console slot aging**: Replace cartridge slot ribbon cable
3. **Motherboard issues**: Send for repair or switch to flash cart
