2. **Charging indicator**: Orange light indicates charging
3. **Full charge**: Charge for about 3-4 hours until orange light turns off
4. **Power on test**: Unplug charger, power on to test battery life
5. **Battery calibration**:
   - After full charge, use normally until automatic shutdown
   - Fully charge again, repeat 2-3 times to complete calibration

### 4. Common Issues & Solutions
#### Issue 1: New Battery Won't Charge
1. Check charger: Confirm charger outputs 5V 2A
2. Check charging port: Clean PSP charging port
