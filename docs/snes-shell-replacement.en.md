## Overview

The Super Nintendo (SNES) shell protects the internal precision electronic components. However, due to long-term use, improper storage, or accidental drops, the shell may develop cracks, discoloration, wear, or damage. This guide provides detailed instructions on safely replacing the SNES shell, giving your console a fresh new look.

## Required Tools

- Phillips screwdrivers (#00, #0, #1 sizes)
- Flathead screwdriver or plastic spudger
- Tweezers
- New SNES shell kit (includes top and bottom shells)
- Isopropyl alcohol and cotton swabs
- Compressed air can
- Anti-static wrist strap (recommended)
- Soft cloth or towel (to protect work surface)
- Small containers (for storing screws and small parts)

## Safety Precautions

1. **Power off operation**: Ensure SNES console completely powered off, unplug all cables
2. **Electrostatic protection**: Wear anti-static wrist strap when handling internal electronic components
3. **Plastic care**: SNES shell plastic may have aged and become brittle, handle with extra care
4. **Parts preservation**: Keep all screws, springs, and small parts in safe location during disassembly
5. **Photo documentation**: Take photos before disassembly to record original assembly and part positions

## Diagnosis & Preparation

### Step 1: Assess Shell Condition
1. **Check damage types**:
   - **Surface wear**: Scratches, discoloration, reduced gloss
   - **Structural damage**: Cracks, breaks, missing sections
   - **Functional impact**: Broken clips, stripped screw holes, deformation

2. **Determine replacement scope**:
   - Need to replace only top shell, bottom shell, or full set
   - Check if button and port openings match
   - Confirm new shell compatible with your SNES model

### Step 2: Select New Shell
1. **Material selection**:
   - **ABS plastic**: Original material, good durability
   - **Recycled plastic**: Eco-friendly option, quality may vary
   - **3D printed**: Custom option, requires precise modeling

2. **Color selection**:
   - **Original gray**: Maintains classic appearance
   - **Clear shell**: Shows internal structure
   - **Colored shell**: Personalized choice
   - **Special coatings**: Matte, glossy, or other surface treatments

3. **Quality inspection**:
   - Check injection molding quality for burrs, shrinkage
   - Check dimensional accuracy compared to original
   - Check clips and screw holes intact

   - Test all openings align properly
   - Check clips and screw holes intact
   - Clean inside of new shell, remove any manufacturing residue

### Step 4: Install into New Shell

1. **Install basic components**:
   - First install power board into new bottom shell (if applicable)
   - Install cartridge slot and related mechanical components
   - Install controller ports

2. **Install motherboard**:
   - Carefully place motherboard into new bottom shell
   - Align all mounting holes
   - Don't tighten all screws yet

3. **Install buttons and switches**:
   - Install power switch
   - Install reset button
   - Install eject button and related springs
   - Test each button action smooth

4. **Connect internal cables**:
   - Connect all internal cables according to original layout
   - Ensure connectors fully inserted and locked
   - Organize cables to avoid pinching or interfering with other components

### Step 5: Final Assembly

1. **Check alignment**:
   - Check all components properly positioned
   - Check all openings aligned
   - Check button and switch functions

2. **Install top shell**:
   - Align top shell with bottom shell
   - Ensure all clips properly engaged
   - Start from one side, gradually close

3. **Tighten screws**:
   - Tighten all screws in diagonal pattern
   - Don't overtighten to avoid damaging plastic threads
   - Use appropriately sized screwdriver to avoid stripping

### Step 6: Function Testing

1. **Visual inspection**:
   - Check shell completely closed, no gaps
   - Check all buttons properly protruding
   - Check all ports unobstructed

2. **Basic function test**:
   - Connect power and video cables
   - Turn on power switch, test indicator light
   - Test reset button
   - Test eject button

3. **Comprehensive function test**:
   - Insert game cartridge, test reading
